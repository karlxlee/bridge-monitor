## Bridge Monitor

Cross-chain bridges rely on validators with high uptime to read and verify transactions. Outages and downtime can harm both the validator (often only the highest quality validators compete for a limited number of spots) and the health of the bridge.

Bridge Monitor monitors for unusual bridge activity in real-time. It alerts engineers and staking companies to exceptional falls and spikes in bridging activity, enabling a rapid response.

## Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
